## **ðŸ“Œ Advanced String Questions (15)**

1. Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.  
```python
# #Using pointers 
# str="strhellohi"
# list_str=list(str)
# i=0
# longest_sub_string=""
# while i <len(list(str)):
#     new_str_list=[]
#     j=i
#     while j < len(list_str): 
#         if(list_str[j] in new_str_list):
#             break
#         new_str_list.append(list_str[j])
#         j+=1

#     if len(new_str_list) > len(longest_sub_string):
#         longest_sub_string=''.join(new_str_list)
#     i+=1
# print(longest_sub_string)


#Using set 

str="strhellohi"

char_set=set()
i=0
j=0
max_str=""


while j < len(str):
    print(f"i is {str[i]}")
    if str[j] not in char_set:
        char_set.add(str[j])
        j+=1
        
        if j-i > len(max_str):
            print(f"i is {i} j is {j}")
            max_str=str[i:j]
            print(max_str)
    
    else:
        print(char_set)
        char_set.remove(str[i])
        i+=1
print(max_str)
